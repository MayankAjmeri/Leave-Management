# Leave Management

## Overview
A Flutter Project for Staff Leave Management. This project aims to change the process of granting and applying for leave. It provides the user an easy way to apply for leaves while also maintains a record of their past leaves. The user can simply fill a form while the software designs and formats it into a formal official document. The admin can easily grant or deny the request thus reducing the latency in the process and eventually making the system more efficient.
